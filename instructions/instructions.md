You will be using React Native, Expo, Supabase, Toast and Zustand.

## Core Functionalities
1. Choose between English and Arabic for the app language. 
    1. Users can choose between two languages for interacting with the app. 
        - If it is a first time user, they will be shown the app in English languge by default. 
        - If it is an existing customer then they will be shown the app in the language they selected previously.
    2. If the user wishes to change the app language, they ca do so in the 'Accounts' tab of the application.

2. Browse the different products seamlessly within the app.
    1. The users will be shown a splash screen for 3 seconds upon opening the app. It will have a white background with the logo of SOUQ MARIA positioned in the middle of the screen.
    2. The users can find products either by searching for the product name or by searching for the category and browsing through the products under the category.
    3. Under the 'Home' tab: 
        - Users will be shown the different categories, which they can click to go to the corresponding category page.
        - User can explore different products on the home page. 
        - They can search for products either from the search bar or through the menu drawer.

3. Add / remove products in the cart and going to checkout.
    1. The user can add a product to cart in the following way:
